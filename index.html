<h2>
Our ocean
</h2>
<p>
The ocean is a vast and powerful part of our earth, covering most of its surface. It’s full of life, from colorful fish and coral reefs to deep, mysterious areas that haven’t been explored just yet. The ocean's waves and tides shape the land and help regulate the Earth’s climate.The ocean is important because as it plays a huge role in supporting life. It provides food, oxygen, and a home for millions of species. The ocean also helps regulate the Earth's climate by absorbing heat and storing carbon. Without an ocean, life on Earth would be very different, and many of the things we depend on would disappear. It’s important to protect the ocean to keep our planet balanced and thriving.

<h2>Protecting Our Oceans</h2>
<p>The ocean faces problems. We can make a difference by reducing plastic use, saving energy, and supporting ocean protection. Our ocean has many problems, like pollution, oil spills, and chemicals. Overfishing and climate change are also hurting marine life. Our oceans are crucial for life on Earth, providing oxygen, food, and regulating the climate. But pollution, overfishing, and climate change are harming them. To protect our oceans, we need to reduce plastic waste, fish sustainably, and fight climate change. Simple actions like using less plastic and supporting ocean conservation can make a big difference in keeping our oceans healthy for the future.</p>

<h2>
 Pollution
</h2>
<p>
The ocean is polluted by plastic, chemicals, and waste from factories and cities. Every year, tons of plastic end up in the water, hurting sea animals and plants. Animals can mistake trash for food or get trapped in it, which can harm or kill them. Chemicals from farms and cities also pollute the water, damaging marine life. This pollution is bad for both the ocean's health and the people who depend on it for food and resources.
